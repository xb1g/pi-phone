# pi-phone

A phone-first remote UI for [Pi](https://pi.dev) that lets you drive a real Pi session from your phone.

`pi-phone` starts a small local web server, launches a dedicated `pi --mode rpc` subprocess in your current project, and mirrors Pi's session state over WebSocket to a mobile web app.

## ✨ What's New (v0.0.9+)

**Major UI Overhaul** - Complete mobile-first redesign with:

- 🌓 **Dark/Light Theme Toggle** - Automatic system theme detection with manual override
- 🎨 **Modern Design** - Refined color palette, smooth animations, gradient backgrounds
- 📱 **Enhanced Mobile UX** - Better touch targets, haptic feedback, safe area support
- ♿ **Full Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- 🚀 **PWA Features** - Offline support, app shortcuts, share target, install prompts
- ⚡ **Performance** - Hardware-accelerated animations, optimized rendering
- 🔔 **Toast Notifications** - Auto-dismissing messages with haptic feedback
- 📊 **Enhanced Status** - Better connection indicators, streaming status, quota display

See [UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for complete details.

## What it gives you

- Phone-friendly chat UI for Pi
- Uses a real Pi subprocess, not a fake wrapper
- Preserves much more of your Pi setup than a custom mini-backend would
- Works with extension commands, prompt templates, and skills exposed by Pi RPC
- Model switching and thinking-level switching from the phone UI
- Session browser, tree browser, fork flow, stats, compact, reload, and refresh actions
- Image upload from the phone UI
- Optional Tailscale Serve auto-setup for remote access from your phone
- Single active-client mode for safety and simplicity

## Requirements

- Pi installed and working
- Tested with Pi `0.58.4`
- Node.js available for extension dependencies
- Optional but strongly recommended: Tailscale installed and logged in if you want easy remote phone access

## Install

Install `pi-phone` from npm with Pi:

```bash
pi install npm:@malinamnam/pi-phone
```

Then either restart Pi or run:

```text
/reload
```

If you want to verify that the package is installed and enabled:

```bash
pi list
pi config
```

## Setup guide

### 1. Open Pi in the project you want to control from your phone

```bash
cd /path/to/project
pi
```

`pi-phone` launches a dedicated child Pi RPC session using the current Pi working directory, so start Pi in the repo you want to work on.

### 2. Start the phone server

Inside Pi:

```text
/phone-start
```

By default this:

- binds the web server to `127.0.0.1`
- uses port `8787`
- uses the current Pi working directory
- sets a `2 hour` idle auto-stop timeout
- auto-generates a token if you did not provide one
- tries to configure Tailscale Serve automatically

### 3. Open the phone UI

There are two common cases:

#### If Tailscale setup succeeds

Pi will show a Tailscale URL like:

```text
https://your-device.ts.net/
```

Open that URL on your phone.

#### If Tailscale setup does not succeed

Pi will keep the local phone server running and show a fallback command. Since the server binds to localhost by default, the easiest path is usually to fix Tailscale and run `/phone-start` again.

### 4. Enter the token if prompted

If you did not explicitly disable the token, the extension requires the token shown by Pi.

You can view it again at any time with:

```text
/phone-token
```

## Command reference

### `/phone-start`

Examples:

```text
/phone-start
/phone-start 8787
/phone-start 8787 mytoken
/phone-start --port 8787 --token mytoken --host 127.0.0.1
/phone-start --cwd /path/to/project
/phone-start --idle-mins 20
/phone-start --idle-secs 90
```

Behavior:

- default host: `127.0.0.1`
- default port: `8787`
- default cwd: current Pi working directory
- default idle auto-stop: `2 hours`
- auto-generates a random token if you do not provide one
- tries to auto-configure Tailscale Serve

Use `-` to explicitly disable the token:

```text
/phone-start 8787 -
```

### `/phone-stop`

```text
/phone-stop
```

Stops the phone server and also disables the matching Tailscale Serve route when possible.

### `/phone-status`

```text
/phone-status
```

Shows whether the phone server is running and whether Tailscale Serve is currently pointing at it.

### `/phone-token`

```text
/phone-token
```

Shows the current token, or tells you that token auth is disabled for the current phone server.

## Typical usage flow

1. Start Pi in your project
2. Run `/phone-start`
3. Open the Tailscale URL on your phone
4. Enter the token once if prompted
5. Work from the phone UI
6. When done, run `/phone-stop`

## What the phone UI can do

The phone UI is built around Pi RPC plus a few local convenience actions. Depending on your current Pi setup, you can:

- Send prompts and messages
- Attach images from your phone
- Abort streaming responses
- Compact the current session
- Start a new session
- Reload extensions, skills, prompts, and themes
- Browse and switch models
- Browse and switch thinking levels
- Browse prompt templates, skills, and extension commands exposed through Pi RPC
- Browse saved sessions
- Browse the current session tree and open a branch path as a new active session
- View session stats and cost stats
- **Toggle dark/light theme** (button in top-right or Alt+T)
- **Receive toast notifications** with haptic feedback
- **Install as PWA** for native app experience
- **Use offline** with cached assets
- **Share content** to Pi Phone (share target)

### New UI Features

- **Theme System**: Dark and light themes with automatic system detection
- **Enhanced Status Card**: Grid layout with icons and hover effects
- **Modern Composer**: Icon-based buttons, horizontal scrolling actions
- **Better Messages**: Gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, improved code blocks
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators with pulse animation for streaming
- **Quota Display**: Color-coded context usage and token quota
- **Toast Notifications**: Auto-dismissing messages for feedback
- **Loading States**: Overlay with spinner for async operations

Because the extension drives a real Pi subprocess, the phone UI preserves much more of your actual Pi environment than a custom standalone web app would.

## Security and runtime behavior

- The phone server binds to localhost by default.
- If you omit the token, Pi generates a random token for you.
- If you set the token to `-`, token auth is disabled.
- Only one active phone client is allowed at a time; a new client replaces the old one.
- The phone server auto-stops after the configured idle timeout.
- The extension removes the matching Tailscale Serve route on idle timeout, `/phone-stop`, and parent Pi shutdown.
- The spawned child Pi process sets `PI_PHONE_CHILD=1` so the extension does not recursively start nested phone servers.
- The phone browser stores the token in local storage for convenience.

## Notes on quota display

The UI includes a quota pill for supported `openai-codex` `gpt-*` models when local Pi auth data makes that information available. If that auth is missing, unsupported, or you are using a different provider, the phone UI still works; the quota pill simply stays hidden.

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

If Pi reports that the port is already in use:

```text
/phone-stop
/phone-start
```

### Tailscale did not auto-configure

Make sure Tailscale is installed, logged in, and available on `PATH`, then try again:

```bash
tailscale status
tailscale serve status
```

You can also use the manual fallback command shown by Pi.

### Invalid token on phone

If the phone UI says the token is invalid, run:

```text
/phone-token
```

Then re-enter the latest token. If needed, restart the server with a fresh token:

```text
/phone-stop
/phone-start
```

### Extension not showing up in Pi

Try:

```text
/reload
```

Then verify the package is present and enabled:

```bash
pi list
pi config
```
